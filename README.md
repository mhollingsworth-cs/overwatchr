overwatchr is a native macOS menu bar utility for terminal-based AI agents. It watches for turns that need a human, keeps a queue in the menu bar, and jumps you back to the right terminal tab before your attention gets shredded.

It is built with Swift, SwiftUI, and native macOS APIs only. No Electron. No tmux dependency. No Hammerspoon.

## Positioning Snapshot

- Core promise: never miss agent handoffs and recover focus instantly to the right terminal tab.
- Primary users: solo builders and small engineering teams running multiple local terminal agents.
- Secondary users: devrel and AI-heavy product teams that demo or operate parallel agent workflows.

## Why it exists

When Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, or other terminal agents are running in parallel, the hard part is not starting them. It is noticing the exact moment one of them needs you, then getting back to the correct tab fast.

overwatchr gives you:

- a menu bar queue of live agent pings
- a global jump shortcut you can change in settings
- a hold-to-talk voice shortcut for dictating into the focused app with Azure Speech
- native terminal focusing for Ghostty, iTerm, and Terminal.app
- local `seen` behavior so opened alerts drop out until the next new event
- hook installers for Codex CLI, Claude Code, and OpenCode

## Install

One-line install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atiti/overwatchr/main/install.sh | bash
```

One-line install plus user-wide hook setup:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atiti/overwatchr/main/install.sh | INSTALL_HOOKS=1 bash
```

By default, the installer:

- puts the CLI in `/usr/local/bin` if writable, otherwise `~/.local/bin`
- installs `Overwatchr.app` into `/Applications` if writable, otherwise `~/Applications`
- leaves hook config untouched unless you opt into `INSTALL_HOOKS=1`

From a local checkout:

```bash
./install.sh
```

If you only want the CLI:

```bash
INSTALL_APP=0 ./install.sh
```

If you want release artifacts without installing:

```bash
scripts/build_app_bundle.sh
```

## Quick Start

1. Install the app and launch `Overwatchr.app`.
2. Grant Accessibility access so terminal focusing works reliably.
3. Install hooks for the tools you use:

```bash
overwatchr hooks install all --scope user
overwatchr shell install --shell zsh
```

That sets up:

- Codex CLI via `~/.codex/config.toml` and `~/.codex/hooks.json`
- Claude Code via `~/.claude/settings.json`
- OpenCode via `~/.config/opencode/plugins/overwatchr.js`
- interactive shell title syncing via `~/.config/overwatchr/shell.zsh`

## Voice Input

Overwatchr can dictate into the currently focused app. In settings, save an Azure Speech key, set the Speech resource region such as `eastus`, and optionally adjust the locale list. Then hold the voice shortcut, speak, and release to insert the transcription.

Defaults:

- Voice shortcut: `⌃⌥⌘Space`
- Provider: Azure Speech Services short-audio recognition
- Locales: `en-US` by default, or comma-separated candidates such as `en-US,hu-HU` for automatic best-result selection
- Submit phrase mode: strips terminal phrases such as `press enter` and sends Return

The Azure Speech key is stored in Keychain. For development runs launched from a shell, these environment variables are also recognized:

```bash
AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=...
AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=eastus
AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com
```

Voice input requires Microphone permission to capture audio and Accessibility permission to paste text and send Return.

Project-local setup also works:

```bash
overwatchr hooks install all --scope project
```

## First 10 Minutes

Use this loop to validate that setup is complete and jump-back behavior works end to end.

1. Install and launch:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atiti/overwatchr/main/install.sh | bash
```

2. In macOS Settings, allow Accessibility for `Overwatchr.app`.
3. Install hooks and shell sync:

```bash
overwatchr hooks install all --scope user
overwatchr shell install --shell zsh
```

4. Trigger deterministic test alerts:

```bash
overwatchr alert --agent onboarding-smoke --project first-run --terminal ghostty --title "onboarding smoke"
overwatchr error --agent onboarding-smoke --project first-run --terminal ghostty --title "error path smoke"
```

5. Confirm success criteria:

- the menu bar queue count increases after the test events
- selecting an alert (or pressing your global shortcut) jumps to the expected terminal tab
- focused alerts disappear from queue as `seen`

## If activation fails

- Accessibility denied: reopen macOS Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility, enable `Overwatchr.app`, then relaunch app.
- Hooks missing/stale: rerun `overwatchr hooks install all --scope user` and verify your hook files in `~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, or `~/.config/opencode`.
- Shell title sync missing: run `overwatchr shell install --shell zsh`, restart shell, then retry test alert.
- Unsupported terminal: use Ghostty, iTerm, or Terminal.app; other terminals may emit events but cannot be focused reliably.

## Manual CLI Usage

You can also write events directly:

```bash
overwatchr alert --agent copy --project landing --terminal ghostty --title "landing:copy"
overwatchr error --agent api --project backend --terminal iTerm2 --title "backend:api"
overwatchr done --agent copy --project landing
```

Events are appended to `~/.overwatchr/events.jsonl`.

Queue behavior:

- `alert` and `error` create or refresh an active alert for that agent
- if the stopping session is already frontmost, overwatchr records the event but auto-marks it seen so you do not get a redundant queue item
- opening an alert marks it `seen` locally, so it disappears until a newer event arrives
- `done` clears it from the active stream
- optional alert chime lives in the menu bar settings pane

Maintenance commands:

```bash
overwatchr events stats
overwatchr events compact
overwatchr events prune --older-than 30d
```

`compact` keeps the latest event per agent and writes a timestamped backup. `prune` drops older history while preserving the latest known event for every agent.

## Hook Bridge

overwatchr includes a native bridge for hook-enabled tools:

```bash
overwatchr hook-run codex
overwatchr hook-run claude
overwatchr hook-run opencode
```

You usually do not call these by hand. The generated hook configs call them for you.

## Supported Terminals

- Ghostty
- iTerm
- Terminal.app

Overwatchr now prefers exact `tty` session matching for iTerm and Terminal.app when the hook process can see a controlling terminal, then falls back to title matching. Ghostty still uses Accessibility window matching plus the `Window` menu fallback because its scripting surface is more limited.

For Ghostty and other terminals that honor standard OSC title sequences, install the shell integration too:

```bash
overwatchr shell install --shell zsh
```

That keeps `OVERWATCHR_TITLE` and the terminal tab title aligned to the current project directory, and appends a short terminal suffix like `ttys099` when available so same-project tabs stay distinguishable.

## Development

```bash
swift build
swift test
swift run overwatchr-app
scripts/build_app_bundle.sh
```

The repository layout is:

- `App/`: menu bar app
- `CLI/`: `overwatchr` executable
- `Core/`: shared queue, store, focus, hook, and installer logic
- `scripts/`: build and smoke helpers
- `Tests/OverwatchrCoreTests/`: unit tests

## Release Flow

- CI builds and tests on macOS via [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Tagged releases package the CLI and app via [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](./.github/workflows/release.yml)
- release tags should use `v*`, for example `v0.1.0`
- tagged GitHub releases require Developer ID signing and notarization secrets; the workflow fails rather than publishing a Gatekeeper-blocked app
- required release secrets are `MACOS_CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12_BASE64`, `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, and `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- local signed builds use `CODESIGN_IDENTITY`; notarization can use either `NOTARY_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` or direct Apple ID credentials

Local signed release example:

```bash
CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Example, Inc. (TEAMID1234)" \
APPLE_ID="dev@example.com" \
APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID1234" \
APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx" \
VERSION=0.2.1 \
scripts/build_app_bundle.sh
```

## Roadmap

- more hook targets
- better terminal title inference
- optional richer notifications beyond the menu bar
